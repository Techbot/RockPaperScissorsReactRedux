# RockPaperScissorsReactRedux
Simple RockPaperScissors  React Redux game based on https://github.com/jackielii/simplest-redux-example/

Idea is to make a game using state and then record these states to event store.
TDD and BDD practices used when possible (based on my limited knowledge).

In Progress: Partitioning event stream

Next: Introduce Command Bus , refactor
